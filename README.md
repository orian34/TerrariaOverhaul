# üî• What's this?
Terraria Overhaul is a *huuuge* game mechanics changing mod for Terraria.
You can read more about it at [this forum page](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/.60369/) (Might be outdated.)

# ‚åö What's the state of the rebuild?
This version is around 60%+ done.
It's missing many features from the 1.3 version, but what's currently implemented is much superior to the old versions.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How do I build this?

Below is a step by step instruction for that. It only assumes that you know at least how to use command prompts, shells, or terminals. You should.

- Get TModLoader from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader) or [GitHub](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/releases).
- Get Git from [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/download) or from a Linux package manager. Most defaults suffice in the installer.
- Get both the [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) & [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) SDKs.
- Clone the mod into `%userprofile%/Documents/My games/Terraria/tModLoader/ModSources`.
The git command for that would be `git clone https://github.com/Mirsario/TerrariaOverhaul -b dev`, where `dev` is the branch you want to clone.
- Build the mod by running `dotnet build` in the cloned folder.

That's all. Use `git pull` to pull new commits, and `git reset origin/dev --hard` to force-reset your local repository.
